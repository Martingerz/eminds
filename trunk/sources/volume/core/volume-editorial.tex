Congratulations! You have in your hands a brand new issue of eMinds: The International Journal on Human-Computer Interaction. If it`s the first time it happens, we can reveal you that this is an international journal that provides a forum for publishing and sharing  research conclusions and development work on different areas of Human-Computer Interaction. If you enjoyed previous issues, we just hope that waiting for volume hasn't been too long!

When we are elaborating a new issue, wich is published annualy, we propose ourselves the challenge of improving the quality of the prior edition through a  proccess that includes a careful selection of published papers as well as a review  workflow made by a board of qualified international researchers from world-wide universities.

As editorial board, we think that experience gained through previous editions, joined with invaluable help from the reviewer team, have favoured that quality of present issue has been increased compared with previous editions. Of course, originality and correction of received works have also contributed to this fact.

The Selection of papers made for this issue include the following ones:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{UseMe: Usable Predictive SMS Systems.} Proposes a predictive system to provide predictive lists when users are typing SMSs
    \item \emph{Haptic Direction Indicator for Visually Impaired People Based on Pseudo-Attraction Force.} Describes a haptic-navigation system that will help blind pedestrians to avoid dangerous areas.
    \item \emph{The role of interactive media features on the affective response: A virtual reality study.} A study aimed to test the impact of the characteristics of Virtual Reality on the affective state of the participants.
    \item \emph{Analysing emotional interaction through avatars. A generic architecture.} This study proposes the use of avatars to generate non-verbal communication in a multimodal interactive system.
    \item \emph{Adaptable Web-based user interfaces: methodology and practice.} This paper proposes an adaptable interface design as an alternative to the traditional design and development
    \item \emph{Usability of the P300 Speller: Towards a more Sustainable Brain-Computer Interface.} This study assessed how the matrix layout of the P300 Speller interface and inter-stimulus interval (ISI) affect task performance and user preference.
    \item  \emph{Enhancing the Accessibility for All of Digital Comic Books.} In this paper, it is explored how a digital version of comic books can be accessed optimally using a computer based interface.
 \end{itemize}

We must say goodbye, but before doing so, we would like to thank everyone who made possible the publication of the journal for one more year. Thank you very much!!
